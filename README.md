The purpose of this project is create a Ecommerce website for my
country that need a website to shop product with cheap price and quality
This project was created my Ayoub Bouagna alone all of this status project was done without team
My personal focus was
1:Created a simple website
2: good experience interface for users
3: Amazing prices and quality
4: Creating this project that mean improve your skills
2. Tell a story about yourself which relates to why you chose to work on this project
Creating a ecommerce website is not easy because you need to fetch all
point and structures that the website needed and as as Software engineering at Alx Africa (cohort 17) you need to do hard things
That your mind needed ,strong SE need the experience &&
projects done at time
In this project I focus in Front end and back end structures
to created a strong website
why i choose this project because since when i have 12 years old
i decided programming and when i see some website
i have a small questions why not creating a website
and when i join Alx
My life was basically changed
and in every place in the world we need in ecommerce website
